## Hello! I'm Dean P. Simmer 
### My pronouns are he/him. Feel free to call me Dean. üòä

### About Me
I have a full time career in software engineering leadership. In addition, I'm pursuing a [Master of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://www.sandiego.edu/engineering/graduate/ms-applied-artificial-intelligence.php) at the University of San Diego. I've got a background in technology and a few other degrees that have shaped how I think about technical and ethical problems in the world today.

### üå± Education
- M.S. in Applied Artificial Intelligence (University of San Diego, 2026* *anticipated*)
- M.A. in Religion with a focus on Church History & Theology (Trinity Episcopal)
- B.A. in History (Hillsdale College)

### üî≠ Work

I am a Vice President of Engineering at Rocket based out of Detroit, Michigan. My teams focus on our client products and we use cloud infrastructure and resources to build and deploy APIs and services for our consumer experiences.

### Previous Projects

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Intelligent Investment Research Agent**
    - **Goal**: Implement an agentic workflow with prompt chaining to deliver a self-improving financial news agent.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI
    - **Outcome**: Agent can retrieve news and stock price information about publicly traded comapnies, including providing sentiment analysis of news coverage and stock price trends.
    - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mojodean/aai-520-group-3-final-project)


- üßë‚Äçüíª **MIDI Detection System for Identifying Classical Music Composers from Sound Bites**
    - **Goal**: Implement LSTM and CNN against a Kaggle MIDI dataset to correctly identify four major classical composers
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, CNN, LSTM
    - **Outcome**: models performed reasonably well for the example, but real advancements are needed to detect more composers at scale.
    - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mojodean/su25-aai511-group3)

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Forcasting the Unemployment Rate for the San Diego Metropolitan Statistical Area**
    - **Goal**: Implement a model leveraging Bureau of Labor Statistics Unemployment Data to forecast future unemployment rates.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, numpy, Pandas, ARIMA, DeepAR
    - **Outcome**: DeepAR model outperformed other models, but isn't necessarily the best use case for it. Additional economic and geopolitical factors are likely needed to effectively build out a production-grade model.
    - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mojodean/su25-aai510-group1)

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Smart Home Energy Consumption Anomaly Detection and Forecasting**
    - **Goal**: Design an IoT system that can detect energy consumption anomalies in a smart home.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Keras (Tensorflow)
    - **Outcome**: Deep learning autoencoder was used for anomaly detection, and an LSTM model was used to predict future energy consumption with 99.84% accuracy in its predictive trends across seven days.
    - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mojodean/aai-530-final-project)

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Predicting Emotion From Speech With A Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Model**
    - **Goal**: Identify and implement a model to detect emotional states in speech.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, librosa, TensorFlow
    - **Outcome**: HuBERT Enhanced and CNN-LSTM Enhanced models both produced greater than 90% accuracy, with CNN-LSTM Enhanced achieving an accuracy rate of 98%.
    - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mojodean/MSAAI501FinalProject_Group7) 


- üßë‚Äçüíª **Predicting Obesity: How Lifestyle and Dietary Factors Shape Weight Outcomes**
    - **Goal**: Identify and implement a model to aid early-detection models for obesity.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, numpy, Pandas
    - **Outcome**: Random Forest Modeling was trained and evaluated against the dataset and found to be the most predictive, at effectively 94% accuracy, of detecting correlative effects of obesity.
    - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mojodean/aai-500-project-obesity-levels)

- üìù *Towards a Christian Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence*
    - 2019 (unpublished)
    - Capstone Research Project for Master of Arts in Religion (Church History & Theology).
    - Focused on how a Christian ethical understanding of humanity might inform a perspective on artificial intelligence. This project looked specifically at the lens of how evangelical theology has a very narrow perspective on human identity and, as a result, cannot speak effectively in response to artificial intelligence.
