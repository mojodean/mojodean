## Hello! I'm Dean P. Simmer 
### My pronouns are he/him. Feel free to call me Dean. üòä

### About Me
I have a full time career in software engineering leadership. In addition, I'm pursuing a [Master of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://www.sandiego.edu/engineering/graduate/ms-applied-artificial-intelligence.php) at the University of San Diego. I've got a background in technology and a few other degrees that have shaped how I think about technical and ethical problems in the world today.

### üå± Education
- M.S. in Applied Artificial Intelligence (University of San Diego, 2026* *anticipated*)
- M.A. in Religion with a focus on Church History & Theology (Trinity Episcopal)
- B.A. in History (Hillsdale College)

### üî≠ Work

I am a Vice President of Engineering at Rocket Companies, based out of Detroit, Michigan. My teams focus on our client products and we use cloud infrastructure and resources to build and deploy APIs and services to deliver incredible experiences for our consumers.  

### Previous Projects

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Predicting Emotion From Speech With A Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Model**
    - **Goal**: Identify and implement a model to detect emotional states in speech.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, librosa, TensorFlow
    - **Outcome**: HuBERT Enhanced and CNN-LSTM Enhanced models both produced greater than 90% accuracy, with CNN-LSTM Enhanced achieving an accuracy rate of 98%.
    - [Github Repository](https://github.com/navanodonavan/MSAAI501FinalProject_Group7/) 


- üßë‚Äçüíª **Predicting Obesity: How Lifestyle and Dietary Factors Shape Weight Outcomes**
    - **Goal**: Identify and implement a model to aid early-detection models for obesity.
    - **Tech Stack**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, numpy, Pandas
    - **Outcome**: Random Forest Modeling was trained and evaluated against the dataset and found to be the most predictive, at effectively 94% accuracy, of detecting correlative effects of obesity.

- üìù *Towards a Christian Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence*
    - 2019 (unpublished)
    - Capstone Research Project for Master of Arts in Religion (Church History & Theology).
    - Focused on how a Christian ethical understanding of humanity might inform a perspective on artificial intelligence. This project looked specifically at the lens of how evangelical theology has a very narrow perspective on human identity and, as a result, cannot speak effectively in response to artificial intelligence.
